Over the course of the years, we have come to the realization that traditional baseball statistics, like batting average, are not sufficient to evaluate a player. But how can we actualy evaluate a player? If batting average is not enough, what is?

This question has been answered in different ways. Billy Beane and Paul Depodesta evaluated their players based on OBP since that stat captured the discipline at the plate of a player. The famous movie Moneyball mentions in a scene that all they care about a player is that he gets on base. Okay, but what if we want to measure HOW a player gets on base, that is where SLG comes in. And esentially, SLG is asking the right question: "A single and a home run are not worth the same, a home run should be worth more." But SLG asumes that a home run is worth 4 times more than a single, a double is worth 2 times more than a single, etc. This is an oversimplifaction of the offensive enviroment and SLG only measures hitting statistics, completely ignoring walks. So in order to address this issues, we can use wOBA which include walks and hit by pitch. The difference is not only that, it also assign weights to each offensive event based on the actual run scored based on their running enviroment. So in the end we get a percentage that is scaled to look like OBP and to ask the question that SLG possess but answers it correctly, but in the end we get the same type of number, an average which is hard to translate to non-technical personel and that does tell us and in the end.
