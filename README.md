Saying that a double is worth more than a single, and hitting a home run is better than hitting a single is one of the most intuitive statement in baseball. But let's say that we wanted to measure HOW much is every outcome of a plate appearance worth, how would we do it? and what is the value that we are using to compare their worth? This questions are the foundations of advanced stats like wOBA, wRAA, wRC+ and oWAR, that aim to evaluate the player based on the value that contribute to run scoring of the team.

Now, in order to calculate this values, we must answer the questions previously posed. The last question is easy to answer, since baseball is a run scoring game we want to know how many runs is every event worth. But now, how can we calculate every event's value? Normaly and ideally what we would do is create an RE24 matrix, which gives us the run expectancy of every possible situation in a baseball regarding runners on the bags and the outs in the inning. After that, we would calculate how much impact each event has in changing the run expectancy value. That way we can evaluate a player and their hitting abilities based on the effect they have on the run expectancy based on their run scoring enviroment.

This is in an ideal world, however in the LMB (Liga Mexicana de Beisbol) or the mexican summer league, not all the data is available to build an RE24 matrix. So some might say that this is the end of the road then. Because we need the matrix to put on the weights of each event to then calculate this advanced stats. However, there is a way of gathering this information.
